  Much time has passed since the millennia-old Empire of MU lost complete and
  utter control over the Continent. As the power of Mu's central government
  continued to wane, feudal lords became engrossed and engaged in inner turmoil
  over control of the continent, ultimately destroying the foundations of their
  society. As petty men strived to become powerful, bloody feuds and bitter
  civil wars ravaged the once beautiful continent and a dark and ominous shadow
  fell over the land. There is but only one path of hope for the Land of MU to
  discover the 8 Sealing Stones that have been scattered across the continent.
  But who will be brave and strong enough to succeed and save MU? MU is a highly
  involved fantasy RPG, based on the legendary continent of MU, where players
  can choose to be among one of five character classes and become a daring
  adventurers in the quest to save the land. Blending fantasy with a medieval
  setting, MU is a true action-based MMORPG.
